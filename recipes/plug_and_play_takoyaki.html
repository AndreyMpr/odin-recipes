    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Burns your tongue, your mouth, and a huge sphere-shaped hole in your heart.
        <br>These takoyaki are as good as you can make them. That's why they aren't that great on the photo.
        <br>But you can do it better!
    </p> 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
    <ul>
        <li>Tako......RIP</li>
        <li>Eggs......multiple</li>
        <li>Takoyaki sauce......for special effects</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take a bunch of eggs. I don't know how many, to be honest. Just enough so that you can put it in a deep bowl and stir it without making too much of a clanking noise.</li>
        <li>I think maybe some flour involved, but just a little.</li>
        <li>Cut tako in very small bits. That majestic, very smart and seemingly self-aware animal.</li>
        <li>Go through a series of existential moral dilemas.</li>
        <li>Pour that egg-flower mix into a takoyaki-maker.</li>
        <li>Stick a piece of tako inside every takoyaki.</li>
        <li>As one side gets fried, turn it over with a toothpick, to get the full sphere shape on every takoyaki.</li>
        <li>Prepare cold beverages for the moment when you inevitably burn your mouth.</li>
        <li>Put some takoyaki sauce and those fish flakes that make it look like it's all moving about.</li>
        <li>お召し上がりください。</li>
    </ol>
